# Weekly Sync: Project Neon
**Date:** 2025-02-15
**Attendees:** Diana, Alice, Bob, Charlie

## Key Decisions
1. **Change in Scope:** Due to complexity, "Offline Mode" is pushed to Phase 2 (post-launch). The PRD will be updated next week.
2. **Backend Delay:** Bob reported that the "Helios" API is running 1 week behind schedule.
3. **Budget Approval:** Finance approved an extra $5,000 for server costs.

## Action Items
* @Alice: Start setting up the React Native repo.
* @Diana: Inform stakeholders about the Offline Mode delay.
* @Charlie: Prepare test cases for Dark Mode.
